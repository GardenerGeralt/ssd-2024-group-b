 SEKR = STIFFNESS MATRIX REDUCTION STEP.
 SELG = LOAD MATRIX GENERATION STEP.
 SELR = LOAD MATRIX REDUCTION STEP. 
 MODES = T (TRUE) IF NORMAL MODES OR BUCKLING MODES CALCULATED.
 DYNRED = T (TRUE) MEANS GENERALIZED DYNAMIC AND/OR COMPONENT MODE REDUCTION PERFORMED.
 SOLLIN = T (TRUE) IF LINEAR SOLUTION EXISTS IN DATABASE.
 PVALID = P-DISTRIBUTION ID OF P-VALUE FOR P-ELEMENTS
 LOOPID = THE LAST LOOPID VALUE USED IN THE NONLINEAR ANALYSIS.  USEFUL FOR RESTARTS.
 SOLNL = T (TRUE) IF NONLINEAR SOLUTION EXISTS IN DATABASE.
 DESIGN CYCLE = THE LAST DESIGN CYCLE (ONLY VALID IN OPTIMIZATION).
 SENSITIVITY = SENSITIVITY MATRIX GENERATION FLAG.
